# Bagol

Bagol is a variant of the Lox programming language as found in [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/) implemented in OCaml. 
Very middling progress has been made thus far on the interpreter, but the plan is to eventually also write an implementation of the bytecode VM that simulates the limitations of C as well. 

## Goals 
- Learn how compilers and interpreters work! 
- Gain familiarity with dune, OCaml's build system
- Write [correct, efficient, and beautiful](https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/cover.html) code 

## Implementation 
The implementation is very close to the textbook's implementation in Java (insert "Hey, can I copy your homework?" meme here). However, in some places we take 
advantage of some of OCaml's functional language features, so these implementations in the text do diverge from the main text in certain places. 
I intend to include a "changelog" of what parts of the implementation I changed, maybe also with a brief explanation for the choices I made. 

## Testing 
does not exist yet :flushed:
